读书消得泼茶香，当时只道是寻常。

# Insomnia by Elizabeth Bishop

	The moon in the bureau mirror
	looks out a million miles
	(and perhaps with pride, at herself,
	but she never, never smiles)
	far and away beyond sleep, or
	perhaps she's a daytime sleeper.
	　　
	By the Universe deserted,
	she'd tell it to go to hell,
	and she'd find a body of water,
	or a mirror, on which to dwell.
	So wrap up care in a cobweb
	and drop it down the well
	　　
	into that world inverted
	where left is always right,
	where the shadows are really the body,
	where we stay awake all night,
	where the heavens are shallow as the sea
	is now deep, and you love me.

# 沈从文与张兆和

	我行过许多地方的桥，看过许多次数的云，喝过许多种类的酒，却只爱过一个正当最好年龄的人。

# 朱生豪与宋清如

	“醒来觉得甚是爱你。”
	“我们都是世上多余的人，但至少我们对于彼此都是世界最重要的人。”
	“我是宋清如至上主义者。”
	“不须耳鬓常厮伴，一笑低头意已倾。”
