# 怎么问“你是哪位？”

最自然、最常用的说法是

	May I ask who's calling？
	请问你是哪位？

不管是直接打给对方、还是让别人转接

	用May I speak to...?"和“Could I speak to...?"都是最保险的

即使是直接打给对方，最好也不要直呼其名想要更礼貌，可以加个please. 

	"May I speak to ... please?"

# 怎么说“我就是...”

最常用的是

	This is + (你的名字)
	This is + (你的名字) speaking

# 怎么说清你是谁？想干嘛？

介绍自己时，This is...比I am...更礼貌

	I'm calling to...或I'm calling from...加简单、明确的介绍，增加沟通效率。

如果你是经朋友，打电话给这个人的，可以说

	This is (你的名字). I'm (介绍人)'s friend.
	I got your number from (介绍人)

# 是否方便接电话？

如果要更礼貌, 可以用Would代替Is:

	Would this be a good time to talk?
	Would this be a convenient time to talk?
	Would you have a minute to talk?

如果方便，可以简单回答

	"Sure. Now is a good time."

如果不方便

	I'm in the middle of a meeting.

也可以直接说

	I'm in the middle of something.

# 挂电话说什么？

	“It was great talking to you."

挂电话前说再见，除了“Bye", 也常用"Talk soon", "Take care"。

# 找其他人怎么说？

	A：Can I speak to Mr Smith, please? / Is Mr Smith there, please?
	B：May I ask who's calling? / Could I have your name, please?
	A：Yes, this is Tom Cruise speaking.

在公司里，接起电话要先报上自己的名字

	Hello, John Smith speaking
	This is John Smith from China Daily. 加上公司名字

# 要找的人不在怎么办？

注意在句首礼貌地加上“I'm afraid”或者 "I'm sorry"

	I'm afraid Mr Smith is out of the office today.
	off sick today/in a meeting/on holiday.
	I'm afraid his line is engaged

接下来，你就可以问对方是否需要留信息

	A：Would you like to leave a message?
	B：Could you ask him to call me back? 
	/ Could you ask him to return my call?

如果你想让对方帮忙捎个信，则要说，
	
	Could you take a message？

# 打给陌生人怎么办？

可能你的老板让你给一个不认识的人打电话，那你就应当先自我介绍，然后提一提老板的名字

	A：Hello, this is Sarah Brown calling, from China Daily.
	B：Hello, what can I do for you? / Hello, how can I help you?
	A：I'm calling on behalf of Tom Cruise.
	/ Tom Cruise suggested that I call you.
	/ Tom Cruise asked me to call you.

# 通话有问题时？

听不清对方说的话

	I'm sorry, could you speak up, please?
	I'm sorry, I can't hear you very well.
	I'm sorry, the line's bad – could you repeat what you just said?

没听懂对方的意思

	I'm sorry, could you repeat that please?
	Sorry, I didn't quite catch that.
	Sorry, I didn't catch your surname.
	I'm sorry, I didn't get that. Could you say it again, please?
	I'm afraid I don't follow you. Could you repeat it, please?
	I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand. Would you mind explaining it again, please?

纠正对方的说法

	Actually, it's 16, not 60.
	I'm sorry, but I think there's been a misunderstanding. 
	I'm sorry, but that's not quite right...

确认自己是否理解正确

	So if I understand you correctly...
	When you say... do you mean...?
